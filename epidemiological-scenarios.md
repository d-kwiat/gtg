# Epidemiological scenarios

We can use `coalestr` to model how different epidemiological scenarios affect parasite genetic diversity and within-host variation.  For example, we can explore:

* how population genetic diversity and within-host variation are affected by changes in $N_h$, $Q$, $\chi$ and $N_m$
* how transmission parameters interact in their genetic effects
* how different epidemiological scenarios can lead to the same genetic effects
* the time it takes for changes in transmission parameters to be reflected in genetic changes

In modelling epidemiological scenarios we are typically interested in events that are relatively **local** and **recent**, e.g. what is happening in a particular district of a country over the past few years, as opposed to events that have occurred in the global parasite population over the past thousand years.

However we have to address the following problem.  In malaria endemic regions, local levels of genetic diversity reflect global patterns of parasite dispersal over several thousand years. That is, if  The problem is that levels of genetic diversity in a local subare strongly affected by events However we have to address the following problem.   is that However we know that the  , occuring on a timescale of a few years rather than centuries.
