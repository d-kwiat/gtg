**One cycle of host-to-host transmission corresponds to one generation of sexual reproduction by the parasite** 

![locus](locus.png).

*Plasmodium falciparum* parasites reproduce asexually and prolifically within the red blood cells of their human  host.  Gametocytes (sexual forms of the parasite) mate after being taken up by a blood-sucking *Anopheles* mosquito.  Their progeny then go through a series of developmental stages to produce sporozoites (asexual forms of the parasite that are inoculated by the mosquito into a new host).  In our model, we define the start of a new generation of transmission as the inoculation of sporozoites into a new host, noting that this occurs shortly after sexual reproduction within the vector.
