# How to use this book

You can browse this book just like any other website. Be warned that we occasionally use population genetic terminology in a very specific way that differs from common usage, so it may help to start by [looking through the glossary](glossary.md).

Many of the pages are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) containing Python code plus some explanatory text, e.g. to explain how we obtained the results shown in the accompanying paper in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22).

You can run the code yourself using the interactive cloud computing service provided by Google Colab. Follow this link to learn [how to use Google Colab](using-google-colab.md) - it is remarkably easy.

Even if you're new to Python you can try out modifications to the code, e.g. to vary the parameter settings of a worked example. Don't worry about making an error, if you get into trouble you can simply refresh the web page and start again.

If you are a more experienced programmer and want to use this code for your own applications, you can [install the `coalestr` module from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/coalestr/) or [view the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/d-kwiat/gtg/blob/main/coalestr.py).
