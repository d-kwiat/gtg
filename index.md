# Welcome

This website introduces the concept of a *genomic transmission graph* for modelling parasite transmission dynamics and population genetics.  It accompanies the paper on this topic that is published in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22).

There are four main parts to this book.

1. We will briefly describe the [underlying concepts](underlying-concepts.md) of the genomic transmission graph.  You might also like to look at the [glossary of terminology](glossary.md).

1. You can use interactive programming to work through examples of the genomic transmission graph on this website using Google Colab.  It is very easy to [set up to use Google Colab](using-google-colab.md). 

1. We will describe the [features of `coalestr`](coalestr-module.md), a Python module designed for rapid simulation of population genetic scenarios using the genomic transmission graph.

1. You can play around with some [epidemiological scenarios](epidemiological-scenarios.md).
