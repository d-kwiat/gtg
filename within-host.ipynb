    "# Within-host diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-host diversity means the genetic diversity of the parasite population within an infected individual.  It is determined by a number of different factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Superinfection* is an important driver of within-host diversity.  It gives rise to the phenomenon known as 'multiclonal infection' or 'mixed infection'. In our model the rate of superinfection is given by $\\chi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiclonal infection may propagate along a transmission chain for several generations subsequent to an episode of superinfection, recombining as it goes.  This is known as *cotransmission*.  Cotransmission is more likely to continue over multiple generations if the quantum of transmission $Q$ is large, and it will not occur if $Q=1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Mutation* and *recombination* also contribute to within-host diversity but at a much lower level than superinfection and cotransmission.  Again this depends on $Q$ which determines the force of genetic drift in eliminating the diversity generated by mutation, recombination and superinfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-host diversity can be quantified by a number of approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity of infection (COI).  This is currently the method most commonly used in malaria epidemiology.  It involves estimating the number of distinct parasite genotypes observed in an infected individual.  Various algorithmic methods have been developed for estimating COI from genetic barcodes, microsatellites, microhaplotyes and other sequence data.  However these methods do not distinguish between unrelated parasites (due to superinfection) and parasites that are related by recombination (due to multiple generations of cotransmission). \n",
