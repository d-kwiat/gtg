# Welcome

This website introduces the concept of a **genomic transmission graph** for modelling parasite transmission dynamics and population genetics.  It accompanies the paper on this topic that is published in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22).

We will use the ['coalestr' module](coalestr-module.md) to examine specific examples of the genomic transmission graph.  You may want to look at the [glossary](glossary.md).

There are four main parts to this book.

1. We describe how to use this book.  It allows you to use interactive programming to work through examples.  This will require using an interactive cloud computing service and you will need to get [set up to use Google Colab](using-google-colab.md). 

1. We will briefly describe the underlying concepts of the genomic transmission graph.  You can also fast forward to the [glossary](glossary.md).

1. We will look at specific features of the 'coalestr' module.

1. We will play around with some epidemiological scenarios.
