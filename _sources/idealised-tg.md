# An idealised model of the transmission graph

![idealised-tg](idealised-tg.png)

We imagine that transmission occurs in non-overlapping generations.  In each generation there are $N_h$ hosts.  Each vector transmits $Q$ alleles to the recipient host.  $\chi$ is the crossing rate of transmission chains: this corresponds to the proportion of hosts that are superinfected from two sources, denoted in the figure by red nodes.
