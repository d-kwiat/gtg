**Heterozygosity is measured by comparing alleles at a locus** 

![locus](locus.png).

An allele is an instance of the parasite genome and a locus is a specific location in the genome.  Here we see three alleles at two loci: locus A is a single nucleotide position (we call this a point locus) and locus B extends over multiple nucleotide positions (we call this a haplotype locus).  Both loci have been affected by mutation, and locus B has also been affected by recombination.
