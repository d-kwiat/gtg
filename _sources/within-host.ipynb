    "# Within-host diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-host diversity means the genetic diversity of the parasite population within an infected individual.  It is determined by a number of different factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Superinfection* gives rise to the phenomenon known as 'multiclonal infection' or 'mixed infection'. In the genomic transmission graph, the rate of superinfection is given by $\\chi$.  There are various empirical methods to estimate the number of distinct clones that are present within an infected individual, a quantity which is generally known as the complexity of infection (COI).\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiclonal infection may propagate along a transmission chain for several generations subsequent to an episode of superinfection - this is known as *cotransmission*.  Cotransmission is more likely to continue over multiple generations if the quantum of transmission $Q$ is large, and it will not occur if $Q=1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Mutation* and *recombination* also contribute to within-host diversity but at a much lower level than superinfection and cotransmission.  Again this depends on $Q$ as this determines the force of genetic drift in eliminating the diversity generated by mutation, recombination and superinfection.\n",
