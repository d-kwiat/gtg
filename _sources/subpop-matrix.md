# Transition probabilities for the four possible states of two lineages within a subpopulation. 

![subpop-matrix](subpop-matrix.png)

At any point in time, two lineages must be (1) separated within the subpopulation or (2) cotransmitted within the subpopulation or (3) coalesced within the subpopulation or (4) entered the metapopulation. If the metapopulation is much larger than the subpopulation then we can treat it as an absorbing state. Row *i* column *j* of the table gives the probability that lineages in state *i* will transition to state *j* if we go back a single generation.
