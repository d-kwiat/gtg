# Welcome

This website introduces the concept of a *genomic transmission graph* for modelling parasite transmission dynamics and population genetics.  It accompanies the paper on this topic in [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22).

We will [explore the underlying concepts](underlying-concepts.md) of the genomic transmission graph.  Before getting started, take a quick look at [how to use this book](how-to-use-this-book.md) as it contains worked examples with Python code that you can run in the cloud without leaving this website.

You can learn [how to use `coalestr`](coalestr-features.md), a Python module designed for rapid simulation of population genetic scenarios using the genomic transmission graph.  Once you are familiar with `coalestr` you can make your own toy models of different [epidemiological scenarios](epidemiological-scenarios.md).
