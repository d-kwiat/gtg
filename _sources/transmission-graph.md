![transmission-graph](transmission-graph.png)

**A genomic transmission graph** representing all the transmission chains in some locality during some interval of time. Each node represents a host, i.e. a person that is carrying parasites and is capable of transmitting them to others.  Each edge represents a vector, i.e. a mosquito that transmits parasites from one host to another, and is therefore directed forwards in time. Red marks a node where transmission chains cross, representing a host that is superinfected.
