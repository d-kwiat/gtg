# Epidemiological scenarios

We can use `coalestr` to model epidemiological scenarios characterised by a recent or transient change in one or more of the transmission parameters $N_h$, $Q$, $\chi$ and $N_m$.  This can be particularly useful in exploring the effects of specific transmission parameters on parasite genetic diversity, both within-host and in the local population.  between-host diversity, and understanding how the same genetic changes   transient rise in the crossing rate of transmission chains like Before we model an epidemiological scenario, we must establish the underlying genetic diversity of
